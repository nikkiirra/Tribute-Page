        <p id="tribute-info">Shaira Luna, considered a “gifted child” and one of the “Promil kids,” grew up living <br> 
            according to the expectations of people around her. She was a child genius after all. <br>
            So it was understandably not easy when she decided to drop out of college. <br>
            <br>
            People thought she would become a doctor before she turned 20—she thought so, <br>
            too— but she dropped out of college, picked up a camera, and went on to become <br>
            one of today’s most prolific photographers in the country. <br>
            <br>
            “It took a lot of courage to step back because all eyes were on me,” she shared, but <br>
            she knew “it wasn’t the path I wanted to get on.” <br>
            <br>
            After shifting to different courses, she left De La Salle University to finally pursue <br>
            photography.</p>
