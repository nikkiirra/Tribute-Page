            Shaira Luna, considered a “gifted child” and one of the “Promil kids,” grew up living 
            according to the expectations of people around her. She was a child genius after all.
            So it was understandably not easy when she decided to drop out of college. 
            People thought she would become a doctor before she turned 20—she thought so, 
            too— but she dropped out of college, picked up a camera, and went on to become
            one of today’s most prolific photographers in the country.      
            “It took a lot of courage to step back because all eyes were on me,” she shared, but 
            she knew “it wasn’t the path I wanted to get on.”  
            After shifting to different courses, she left De La Salle University to finally pursue 
            photography.

                Why Shaira Luna? Why not other professional 
                photographers known internationally? 
                I look up to Shaira because she has the strength   
                to stand up and reach for her own dreams. 
                She’s an intelligent kid, people expected and wanted her to 
                become a doctor. But she chose photography.
                I admired her bravery and perseverance despite the doubters
                of her chosen field. Not only that, the artistry in her craft is truly innate in her as
                if she had been doing this her whole life.
                She may be known as the 90’s brightest kid but Shaira has 
                eyes for art and photography. That’s why it’s Shaira for me.
